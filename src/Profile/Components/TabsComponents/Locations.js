      you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old
      windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss
      the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the
      night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with
      his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson
      sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the
      Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue
      and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and
      cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes
      when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I
      wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought
      well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again
      yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and
      first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could
      feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I
      said yes I will Yes.
