      <h1>History</h1>
      In the first place we have granted to God, and by this our present charter
      confirmed for us and our heirs forever that the English Church shall be
      free, and shall have her rights entire, and her liberties inviolate; and
      we will that it be thus observed; which is apparent from this that the
      freedom of elections, which is reckoned most important and very essential
      to the English Church, we, of our pure and unconstrained will, did grant,
      and did by our charter confirm and did obtain the ratification of the same
      from our lord, Pope Innocent III, before the quarrel arose between us and
      our barons: and this we will observe, and our will is that it be observed
      in good faith by our heirs forever. We have also granted to all freemen of
      our kingdom, for us and our heirs forever, all the underwritten liberties,
      to be had and held by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs forever.
