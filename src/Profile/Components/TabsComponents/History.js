      <h1>History of Real Estate</h1>
      History of Real Estate Real estate has a long history, evolving from basic
      shelter needs in ancient civilizations to the complex global market we see
      today. Early property ownership was limited to rulers, religious
      institutions, and the wealthy, with land being passed down through
      families or tribes. During the Industrial Revolution, rapid urbanization
      led to the creation of commercial and residential properties to
      accommodate workers moving to cities. The 20th century brought new
      innovations, such as mortgage financing and suburban developments, making
      homeownership accessible to a broader population. Post-World War II, the
      demand for housing soared, shaping the modern real estate market. Today,
      technology plays a significant role, with online platforms revolutionizing
      how properties are bought and sold. Real estate investments have become a
      key part of global economies, driven by both residential and commercial
      growth. As sustainability and smart technology become more integrated, the
      industry continues to adapt to the changing needs of society. From ancient
      lands to modern cities, real estate has always mirrored societal progress.
      The sector remains a vital part of global economies, representing both a
      means of livelihood and wealth creation.
