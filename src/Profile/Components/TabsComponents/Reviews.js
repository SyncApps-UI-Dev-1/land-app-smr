      Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and
      meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls deified among the tiers of
      shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on
      the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the
      cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the
      rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small
      boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners,
      wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the
      afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog
      cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little apprentice
      boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a
      nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a
      balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.
